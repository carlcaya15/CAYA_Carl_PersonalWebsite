				<p>My name is Carl Stephen G. Caya. A student of the University of Southeastern Philippines. I am a BSIT student under the Institute of Computing. I am currently 18 years old. I live with my Mom and Dad. I have one younger sister. And I also live with Uncle, so technically there are five of us currently living in the house.</p>

			<p>I have my own hobbies and likes. I love to sing, dance, play instruments, play computer games, and also to play like basketball and stuffs. I also like when I hangout with my friends in our leisure time. But the most thing I love the most is sleeping, because it is hardly to get when you're an IT student, if you know what I mean.</p>
